Milestone Project 2 - Blackjack!
Rules referenced from https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/
Setup:
    Classes:
        Deck
        Cards
        Hands - have cards[], a bet amount, a status, and outcome.
        Players - have a bankroll, hands[]

Per Play:
    Get player bet amount
        - Default based on last bet
        - Place bet

    Shuffle cards

    Draw cards:
        Assign cards to each hand to each player
        Print first dealer card
            - get total of both cards
        Print both player cards
            - get total of both cards
            - If DEALER total == 21 and PLAYER Total < 21, Dealer Wins the round
                - if Dealer Total == 21 and Player Total == 21, go to Tie
            - if 21, pay 1.5x and end
            - Ask to hit or stay
                - Hit: add new card to total
                    - if total <21, ask to hit or stay
                    - if total == 21, go to BlackJack Win (no 1.5x pay though)
                - Stay
